# product-classification
This repository is used for my thesis about product classication. In both notebooks EDA is done and a few models have been tested to find the best suited model setup for classifying Albert Heijn products in categories.

- BERTje.ipynb is a notebook created for the BERT for sequence classification classification. It uses the Dutch pre-trained BERTje to create tokens of the descriptions and classify the products in a small test product taxonomy.
- Baselines.ipynb is a notebook created for some more simpler models. The models are TF-IDF, Word2Vec & FastText in combination with an XGBoost classifier.
